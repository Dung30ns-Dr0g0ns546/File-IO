# Algorithm for File IO

main()

Read file "data.csv"
Declare "inFile" as ifstream
Declare "converter" as stringstream
Declare "currentLine" as string
Declare "sNumb1," "sNumb2," and "text" as string

Use inFile to open file "data.csv"
While getLine is having ifFile stores the data in currentLine, have getLine format the next line it reads as "sNumb1, sNumb2, "text""
